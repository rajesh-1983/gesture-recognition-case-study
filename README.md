Problem Statement
====================
Recognize following gestures captured on webcam attached to Smart-TV and process to relevant operation based getures.

    Thumbs up: Increase the volume
    Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
    Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
    Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds
    Stop: Pause the movie
    
In this  project, We are using folowing 2 architectures to build the model and that will be able to predict the 5 gestures correctly.

  1. Convolution - RNN architecture
  2. CNN with 3D convolution
